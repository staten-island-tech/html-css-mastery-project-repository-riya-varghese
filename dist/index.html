It is the second largest mall by total land area, and the 26th-largest shopping mall in the world by gross leasable area, tying with West Edmonton Mall and Fashion Island (Thailand) — both of which are older than it. It has a total retail floor area of 502,000 square metres (5,400,000 sq ft). Located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, it is part of the 20-billion-dollar Downtown complex (called Downtown Dubai), and includes over 1,200 shops.[1][2][3] In 2011, it was the most visited building on the planet, attracting over 54 million visitors each year.[4] Access to the mall is provided via Doha Street, rebuilt as a double-decker road in April 2009.[5]
